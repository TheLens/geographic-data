## Contributing to this project

Please post any bug reports, feature requests, questions or just about anything else on the [Issues](https://github.com/TheLens/geographic-data/issues) page. Send anything you'd like to keep private to tthoren@thelensnola.org.

#### How you can contribute

A few ideas for both developers and non-developers:

* Bug reports! I catch what I can, but need more help spotting other bugs.
* Alert me of any outdated files, broken URLs and other accumulated rust.
* Help improve the documentation, whether it's by fixing typos or adding new sections. Anything that helps make it clearer and more inviting to future users is welcome.
* Send me links to your apps or stories that use these files. Let me know that you've made use of this repo so I know to continue contributing to it.
* Add or suggest other geographic files for the rest of the Louisiana, its cities and any other geographic boundaries. This repo focuses on New Orleans for now because The Lens is based out of New Orleans, but I'd like to expand this repo to the rest of Louisiana.
* Upload geographic files obtained through public records requests or other means not publicly available online. Help everyone benefit by uploading any files you have! If you do this, please also include any attached documentation and your notes about where the data came from, when it was last updated, who to contact for more information and any other relevant details.

#### Developers

Please use `make` and command-line tools, if possible. If you must, Python and JavaScript are also acceptable. I don't know other languages well enough to adequately maintain them, so please stick to these languages.

Implement suggested features by scripting the full (or partial) pipeline: download, unzip, convert coordinates, remove unnecessary shapes, merge anything necessary, create simplified versions and export to various file formats.

__Code style__

There is no style guide that you need to worry about following. If I see something I'd rather change, I'll change it myself. Don't sweat the small stuff.

__Tests__

No tests are needed, mainly because this repo has no tests. Hey, there's a good idea for how you can contribute!

__Setup for development__

Before you can begin work on the repo, you'll want to make sure you have everything set up correctly. See the "Setup" section of the `README` for installation instructions. You will need ogr2ogr and TopoJSON (and therefore also node.js).
